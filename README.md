Tired to **manually** manage your experiments? Experimaestro manager
gives you a systematic way to write and run experiments where parameters varies.

The overall goals of the experimaestro manager are to:

* Decompose experiments into a set of parameterizable tasks
* Schedule tasks and handle dependencies between tasks
* Avoids to re-run the same task two times by computing unique task IDs dependending on the parameters


Experimaestro is in an **alpha** state. There is an [associated documentation](http://bpiwowar.github.io/experimaestro/).
