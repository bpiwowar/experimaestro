Experimaestro manager gives you a systematic way to write and run experiments where parameters varies. The overall goals of the experimaestro manager are to: Decompose experiments into a set of parameterizable tasks Schedule tasks and handle dependencies between tasks Avoids to re-run the same task two times by computing unique task IDs dependending on the parameters Documentation Experimaestro is in an alpha state.

For example, file:///a/b/c denotes a local folder or file, while xpm:token:user@hostname.org corresponds to a token used to limit the number of launched processes on a given computer. Connectors : Connectors specify how a resource can be accessed and how processes can be launched. Single connectors (i.e., localhost and ssh) are built-in. Composite connectors (i.e., describing a cluster of computers) can be built from single connectors. Resource state : A resource can be in the state WAITING (waiting for dependencies to be met), HOLD (waiting a user action) consequently to a dependency being in the ERROR or HOLD state. DONE when completed, ERROR . For tasks that can be run, two other states are possible: READY (waiting to be run), RUNNING , Groups : One should allow to set a group for a set of experiments. For example: I run several series of experiment and call them \"trec.test1\", \"trec.test2\". I can then operate on all the resources of a specific group, like e.g. \"trec\" or \"trec.test1\". General architecture Resources We have the following types of resources: Data: the output of one job (one job can have several outputs). Some data can also be already generated by an external process (e.g. a data collection) and be declared to experimaestro as read. Data can be in three states: WAITING , HOLD or DONE .
