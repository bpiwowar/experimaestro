Goals

  The goals of the experimaestro manager are:

  * Decompose experiments into a set of parametrised tasks
  
  * Standardise the way to run experiments for easier reproduction of experimental results
    in computing science
     
  * To build a documentation for each task
  
  * Uses the scheduler to run jobs
  
  * Provides multiple way to write tasks. Currently, only JavaScript is supported but this could be extend to Python.

  * To handle easy to read & write experimental plans. For example,
    "<<<collection.id=trec.1/adhoc,trec.2/adhoc * qir.weighting-scheme=tf-idf,tf>>>" 
    will run four experiments where the different parameters (id and weighting shemes) are varied

  * (<<<Not implemented>>>) To manage data produced by the tasks
  

Main concepts

  The main concepts of the manager are:

  * Each input or output is an XML document. 
  
  * Tasks are the unit on which experiments are built, corresponding roughly to the execution of a process.
  

* Input/output
 
  Each input or output can be characterised by a XML qualified name (namespace and local name).
  This allows for a lot of flexibility: input/outputs can be any valid XML document, but can
  also typed using the same mechanism than in XML Schema. In that case, validation can be used to ensure the input or output
  is as expected.
    
  This qualified name is important to distinguish the different data types.
  For example,

%{code-snippet|brush=xml|file=src/site/code/manager_1.xml}

  is an output with the name <<<example>>> within the namespace <<<http://my.ns>>>.
  It is further identified by the <<<id>>> of value <<<abc1>>>.
  
  Input/output are discussed further in {{{manager/xml.html}this document}}
  
* Tasks
 
  Each <<task>> is produced by a <<task factory>>. A task factory has a set of named inputs, a set of named outputs, and a creation method.
  
  Tasks are the units that are used to build up experiments.

  Tasks and task factories are described further {{{manager/tasks.html}this document}}
